The **Blog** is my personal archive of coding challenges — every problem I solve, every approach I try, and every lesson I learn along the way.  

Each problem is documented as a blog post:
- **Problem statement** and **link** to the source (e.g. LeetCode).  
- My **approach**, broken down step by step.  
- The **solution code**, explained in plain words.  
- **Status tags** (e.g. `solved`, `still-solving`, `need-optimization`).  

Read the following for different requirements:
- ### **Archives**
    - Here you’ll find a chronological list of all the problems I’ve documented.  
    - Use this page if you want to **browse through the journey as it unfolded in time** — day by day, log by log.

- ### **Categories**
    Problems are grouped here by **type and topic** —  
For example:  

- **Data Structures** (`arrays`, `linked-list`, `stack`, `tree`)  
- **Algorithms** (`dp`, `greedy`, `backtracking`, `graph`)  
- **Difficulty** (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`)  

Browse categories to focus on the areas you want to practice, or see how my solutions evolve across different problem types.

- ### **Tags**
Tags let me annotate problems with more context.  

I’ll be using tags like:
- **Source**: `leetcode`, `interview`, `custom`  
- **Status**: `solved`, `still-solving`, `need-optimization`, `bruteforce`  
- **Language**: `python`, `sql`, `cpp`  

This way, you can filter problems not only by what they are, but also by **where I found them** and **how far I’ve taken the solution**.



This isn’t about perfection — it’s about progress. The goal is to create a transparent, growing library of problem-solving patterns I can revisit and others can learn from.  

Think of it as my **training dungeon**: every solved problem is another step in building mastery.
